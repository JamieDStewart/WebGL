# 04: Hello Maths

This demonstration introduces 3D rendering through the use of projection matrices. In order to utilise this quite a bit of math functionality for Vectors and Matrtices is required to be written.  
This Maths functionality is all contained within teh glmaths.js script. It covers Vector 2, 3 & 4 creation and mathematical operations. This script additionally contains matrix code for 3x3 and 4x4 matirces.  
Matrices in this glmaths script are stored in column based order, as is the OpenGL way of storing matrices.

# WebGL2

This is a series of small developemnt projects that cover the implementation and creation of various WebGL techniques.
I aim to cover everything from the simple act of creating a WebGL context and drawing some basic geometry to loading
complex 3D scenes from various file formats.  
  
I will aim to maintain the readability and performace of any code that is written in these examples, but I will give
preferential treatment to readability of the code base over the performance of the code where an overlap in this field
is not able to be reached.  
  
It is my initial thoughts to not make use of any 3rd party libraries, although this may change I would prefer to implement
any code that is required for this series and to keep it self contained.  
The code in these subfolders will be discussed and demonstrated on the accompanying [blog/website](https://jamiedstewart.github.io).
